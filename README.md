# Why this exists / what it is

We build these workloads to demonstrate real-world retail scenarios and to **measure their performance on different Intel hardware platforms.** They’re released as open source so partners can read the code and the metrics instrumentation, **run the benchmarks themselves to reproduce the numbers we publish,** or swap in their own models, pipelines, and business logic and see exactly how performance changes. These are **open-source reference pipelines built on Intel® hardware and software, GStreamer, and OpenVINO™**, running real-time object detection and classification at the edge.

It answers one question: **“How do I know if Intel’s hardware will actually perform for *my* workload?”** So it’s a **hardware-sizing tool**, not a production starting point.

The conversation we want: *“Here’s a real workload. Run it. Compare it. Let’s talk about what you’re actually seeing”*, not a TOPS spec sheet.

## Use cases in this repo

The workloads **build on each other**. Start with a basic self-checkout, add a concurrent age-verification pipeline for a real-world lane, then the loss-prevention scenarios themselves, and finally an LVLM enhancement. Each layer adds compute, so the progression is also a **hardware-sizing** story (see use-case density). Each is selected by a `CAMERA_STREAM + WORKLOAD_DIST` config pair in `configs/`, with CPU / iGPU / NPU / hetero variants where available ([matrix](#per-use-case-walkthroughs)).

### 1 · Self-checkout
*The base everything else builds on. Migrated from the EOL ASC repo.*

A self-checkout vision pipeline that identifies products as they’re scanned. YOLO11n detects the item, EfficientNet-B0 classifies it (`asc_object_detection_classification`).

*Business takeaway*: the entry point. Can this Intel box run a basic self-checkout lane at the frame rate it needs? Everything below adds load on top of this.

### 2 · Self-checkout + age verification
*Builds on 1. Adds a parallel face pipeline for a real lane.*
Add a **second, customer-facing pipeline** so the *same lane* can clear **age-restricted purchases** (alcohol, tobacco) without a staff override. A realistic lane now runs **two pipelines at once**: one camera scanning products (yolo11n then efficientnet-b0), one camera watching the customer (face detection then age and gender). That is the **multi-pipeline-per-lane** step.

It ships in four placements, selected by the `WORKLOAD_DIST` you pass: everything on the iGPU, everything on the CPU, everything on the NPU, or **split across the iGPU and NPU** with one stage of each pipeline on each accelerator. Running the density test on the iGPU-only and the split versions and comparing them is how you see what accelerator placement is worth on your hardware (see the [walkthrough](#per-use-case-walkthroughs)).

*Business takeaway*: shows whether a box can run a **complete lane** (scanning plus the age-verification pipeline for unattended alcohol/tobacco sales) at the frame rates the lane requires.

### 3 · Loss prevention
*Builds on 1. Six-camera lane, one shrink scenario per camera.*
Now layer the **actual loss-prevention scenarios** on top. *As a retail operator, I want to detect common loss scenarios at the lane so that I can reduce shrink without adding staff.* The default workload models a single lane as **six cameras**, each running a scenario detector:

| Camera | Scenario detector | Camera | Scenario detector |
|--------|-------------------|--------|-------------------|
| cam1   | Items-in-Basket   | cam4   | Multi-Product Identification |
| cam2   | Hidden Items      | cam5   | Product Switching |
| cam3   | Fake-Scan Detection     | cam6   | Sweethearting |

Run with `make run-lp`. (*This 6-camera lane is the concrete example of use-case density.*)

### 4 · Loss prevention with an LVLM
*Builds on 3. Adds a vision-language model at the edge.*
Push item-recognition accuracy beyond traditional CV with a **local Large Vision-Language Model**, invoked by an agent *only when CV is too generic or uncertain*, with no custom training (`vlm`). E.g. “bottle” → “Heinz Ketchup 32 oz”, seasonal/regional packaging, produce varieties, partially obscured or bulk-bagged items, age-restricted variants with changed packaging.

*Business takeaway*: fewer false positives (less customer friction, fewer staff interventions), better real-loss capture, and adaptability to new/seasonal/regional products **without a retraining cycle.** It’s the suite’s **GenAI-at-the-edge** workload, and it reports the metrics that matter for LLM/LVLM sizing (**TTFT, token throughput**, CPU/GPU/NPU utilization). Runs entirely locally, no cloud dependency.



## Scope & related repositories
This repo covers loss prevention at the self-checkout and point of sale, built on the Automated Self-Checkout foundation above. Store-wide loss prevention is a separate effort in the Intel Retail AI Suite:

- **Store-wide loss prevention**: suspicious-activity and behavioural analysis, person-of-interest re-identification and alerting. See [`intel-retail/storewide-loss-prevention`](https://github.com/intel-retail/storewide-loss-prevention).
- **Other suite use cases**: [Order Accuracy](https://github.com/intel-retail/order-accuracy), [Voice-Enabled Interactions](https://github.com/intel-retail/voice-enabled-interactions), and [Digital Signage](https://github.com/intel-retail/digital-signage).

> Each use case in *this* repo is selected by a `CAMERA_STREAM` + `WORKLOAD_DIST` config pair (`configs/`). Device variants — **CPU / iGPU / NPU / hetero** — vary by use case; see the [matrix](#per-use-case-walkthroughs).

## What to expect when you run it
- **Visual mode** (`RENDER_MODE=1 DISPLAY=:0`) opens a video window with detection overlays/alerts; the pipeline runs until the video completes. **Headless mode** runs the same pipeline for servers and automated benchmarking.
- These are **off-the-shelf, non-fine-tuned models**: *expected* misclassifications under real-world conditions are part of an authentic evaluation, not defects to hide. The goal is a faithful performance picture, not a flawless demo.
- For a 15 fps source, a healthy stream holds **~15 fps per stream**; throughput, latency, and utilization vary by platform and configuration (see §4).
- Output files (visual + headless): `results/pipeline_stream*.log` (per-stream FPS) and `results/gst-launch_*.log` (full GStreamer output). First run downloads videos, models, and images, so it takes a while.

## How to think about performance & stream density
The metrics that matter: **FPS, end-to-end latency, CPU/GPU/NPU utilization, power, and stream density** (for GenAI/LVLM use cases also **TTFT** and **token throughput**).

- **Stream density = the most concurrent streams a box sustains at a target FPS.** Because an LP lane is **multi-camera** (six cameras at potentially different frame-rate needs), density is best read as **use-case instances**: “how many shopping lanes with this use case running per box”, judging **each camera against its own FPS target** (use-case density, not a raw stream count).
- **Reading the result:** a stream cannot sustain more than its source FPS, so any per-stream reading **above** the source rate is a measurement artifact rather than real throughput. Two things cause it. The counter tallies whole frames inside a fixed window, and the window boundary does not line up with frame arrivals, so a window catches one frame more or fewer than expected. On a 15 fps source that shows up as readings of 14, 15 and 16 on a stream whose average is exactly 15, and it happens on a perfectly healthy stream. Under load a second cause appears: a pipeline that has fallen behind processes its buffered frames in a burst as it recovers. That is real work, but it is not a rate the pipeline can hold.
- **How we measure it:** we ramp the number of streams, let each step settle, then read the sustained per-stream FPS against the target to find the most streams that hold it. `INIT_DURATION` controls the **settle time** — how long the pipelines run before any FPS samples are taken at each density step, so warm-up effects (model load, buffering, autoscaling) are excluded from the measurement. Its default is **60 seconds** (`INIT_DURATION ?= 60` in the `Makefile`). `MEASUREMENT_WINDOW_SECONDS` then controls how long FPS samples are collected for each density step. Its default is **30 seconds**, and a result must pass **two consecutive measurement windows** by default. Each window is evaluated independently; windows are not combined into one longer window. A longer settle time gives the pipelines more time to stabilize before measuring, and a longer window can reduce short-term measurement noise, but both increase the total benchmark duration. The resolved settle time is also printed in the stream-density result summary. For example:

  ```sh
  make benchmark-stream-density \
    INIT_DURATION=120 \
    MEASUREMENT_WINDOW_SECONDS=60
  ```

### How the target FPS is selected

The stream-density benchmark resolves the effective target FPS for each camera using this precedence:

1. `TARGET_FPS` environment variable, when explicitly supplied. This overrides the camera configuration for every stream.
2. Per-camera `targetFps` in the selected `camera_to_workload_*.json` file. This is the explicit benchmark target for that camera.
3. Per-camera `fps` in the camera configuration. This is used as the fallback target when `targetFps` is not present or is not a positive value.
4. The default target FPS, currently `14.95`, when neither camera field provides a positive value.

`TARGET_FPS` is an environment/command-line override, while `targetFps` and `fps` are JSON fields. The resolved target value and its source are recorded in `stream_density.log` so the benchmark result can be audited.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 24.04 or newer (Linux recommended), Desktop edition (or Server + GUI).
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (`sudo apt install make`)
- **Python 3** (`sudo apt install python3`) - required for video download and validation scripts
- Intel hardware (CPU, iGPU, dGPU, NPU) + drivers:
    - [Intel GPU drivers](https://dgpu-docs.intel.com/driver/client/overview.html)
    - [NPU](https://dlstreamer.github.io/dev_guide/advanced_install/advanced_install_guide_prerequisites.html#prerequisite-2-install-intel-npu-drivers)
- 32 GB RAM . 300 GB Storage
- Corporate proxy / optional RTSP config:
    ```sh
    # HTTP/HTTPS Proxy settings
    export HTTP_PROXY=<HTTP PROXY>
    export HTTPS_PROXY=<HTTPS PROXY>
    export NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,rabbitmq,minio-service,rtsp-streamer
    # Optional RTSP Configuration (defaults shown)
    export RTSP_STREAM_HOST=rtsp-streamer  # Hostname of RTSP server
    export RTSP_STREAM_PORT=8554           # RTSP port
    export RTSP_MEDIA_DIR=../performance-tools/sample-media  # Video source directory
    export STREAM_LOOP=false               # Set to 'true' to loop video streams indefinitely
    ```
## QuickStart
```sh
git clone -b <release-or-tag> --single-branch https://github.com/intel-retail/loss-prevention  # e.g. v4.0.0
cd loss-prevention
RENDER_MODE=1 DISPLAY=:0 make run-lp      # visual: see detections live (recommended first run)
make run-lp                               # headless
make down-lp                              # stop the application
```

First run downloads videos, models, and images (several minutes). By default `make run-lp` pulls **pre-built images,** runs **headless**, and uses the **Loss Prevention (CPU)** workload. Add `REGISTRY=false` to build images locally instead (see [Advanced](#advanced-usage)).

## Per-use-case walkthroughs
Each use case supports three actions: **run** it, **benchmark** a fixed load, and measure **stream density**. They are listed below in the same order they’re introduced above. The device target is selected by the `WORKLOAD_DIST` config, but **not every use case ships every device variant**, so check the matrix below before swapping a suffix.

| Use case | `WORKLOAD_DIST` variants available |
|---|---|
| ASC — object detection | `_cpu` · `_gpu` · `_npu` |
| ASC — object detection + classification | `_cpu` · `_gpu` · `_npu` · `_hetero` |
| ASC — age verification | `_cpu` · `_gpu` · `_npu` · `_hetero` |
| Loss Prevention (core, 6-camera) | `_cpu` · `_gpu` · `_gpu-npu` · `_hetero` (no `_npu`) |
| LVLM-enhanced | none — single `workload_to_pipeline_vlm.json`; devices are set inside the JSON (`device`, `vlm_device`) |

Run `ls configs/workload_to_pipeline_*` to confirm what your checkout provides. Passing a variant that doesn't exist fails fast — `make run-lp` validates the pair first and reports `Configuration file not found: configs/<name>.json`.

#### 1 · Self-checkout

**Run it, detection + classification on the iGPU**
```sh
make run-lp CAMERA_STREAM=camera_to_workload_asc_object_detection_classification.json WORKLOAD_DIST=workload_to_pipeline_asc_object_detection_classification_gpu.json RENDER_MODE=1 DISPLAY=:0
```

**Measure its stream density**
```sh
make benchmark-stream-density CAMERA_STREAM=camera_to_workload_asc_object_detection_classification.json WORKLOAD_DIST=workload_to_pipeline_asc_object_detection_classification_gpu.json
```

**See the results**
```sh
make consolidate-metrics && cat benchmark/metrics.csv
```

#### 2 · Self-checkout + age verification

**Run scanning and age verification together, both on the iGPU.** Two cameras: one scanning products, one doing face detection and age prediction.
```sh
make run-lp CAMERA_STREAM=camera_to_workload_asc_age_verification.json WORKLOAD_DIST=workload_to_pipeline_asc_age_verification_gpu.json
```

**Measure the use-case density of that lane** (how many of these lanes the box sustains)
```sh
make benchmark-stream-density CAMERA_STREAM=camera_to_workload_asc_age_verification.json WORKLOAD_DIST=workload_to_pipeline_asc_age_verification_gpu.json
```

**Run the same lane with the work split across the iGPU and NPU.** Same two cameras and same models, but each pipeline now puts one stage on the iGPU and the other on the NPU, so you can see what the split costs or buys.
```sh
make run-lp CAMERA_STREAM=camera_to_workload_asc_age_verification.json WORKLOAD_DIST=workload_to_pipeline_asc_age_verification_hetero.json
```

**Measure the use-case density of the split lane**
```sh
make benchmark-stream-density CAMERA_STREAM=camera_to_workload_asc_age_verification.json WORKLOAD_DIST=workload_to_pipeline_asc_age_verification_hetero.json
```

**See the results**
```sh
make consolidate-metrics && cat benchmark/metrics.csv
```

#### 3 · Loss prevention

The default six-camera lane. No config pair needed.

**Run it, with video output**
```sh
RENDER_MODE=1 DISPLAY=:0 make run-lp
```

**Benchmark a fixed load**
```sh
make benchmark
```

**Measure the maximum sustainable lanes**
```sh
make benchmark-stream-density
```

**See the results**
```sh
make consolidate-metrics && cat benchmark/metrics.csv
```

#### 4 · Run Loss prevention with the VLM Workload With Qwen Model (Default)

**Set the credentials it needs**
```sh
export MINIO_ROOT_USER=<...> MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=<...>
export RABBITMQ_USER=<...> RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=<...>
export GATED_MODEL=true HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=<...>
```

**Run it**
```sh
make run-lp CAMERA_STREAM=camera_to_workload_vlm.json STREAM_LOOP=false
```

**Benchmark it**
```sh
make benchmark CAMERA_STREAM=camera_to_workload_vlm.json WORKLOAD_DIST=workload_to_pipeline_vlm.json
```

#### 4 · Run Loss prevention with the VLM Workload With MINICPM Model

Set the credentials needed by the VLM workflow before you run it:

```bash
export MINIO_ROOT_USER=<...> MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=<...>
export RABBITMQ_USER=<...> RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=<...>
export GATED_MODEL=true HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=<...>
```

Use the dedicated VLM camera and workload configs:

Edit the existing VLM config files:

- `configs/workload_to_pipeline_vlm.json`

Update the VLM entry to:

- `vlm_model`: `openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5`
- `vlm_precision`: `int4`

```bash
make download-models \ 
  WORKLOAD_DIST=workload_to_pipeline_vlm.json


make run-lp \
  CAMERA_STREAM=camera_to_workload_vlm.json \
  WORKLOAD_DIST=workload_to_pipeline_vlm.json \
  OVMS_MODEL_NAME='openbmb/MiniCPM-V-4_5-int4'
```

Benchmark the same VLM workload after the service is up:

```bash
make benchmark \
  CAMERA_STREAM=camera_to_workload_vlm.json \
  WORKLOAD_DIST=workload_to_pipeline_vlm.json
```

__What to Expect__
  
+ *Visual Mode*
  - Opens a video window with retail footage and detection overlays.
  - The pipeline runs until the input video finishes.
      
    **Note: The pipeline runs until the video completes**

+ *Visual and Headless Mode*
   - Verify that these output files are created and contain data:     
     - `<loss-prevention-workspace>/results/pipeline_stream*.log`: per-stream FPS metrics (one value per line)
     - `<loss-prevention-workspace>/results/gst-launch_*.log`: full GStreamer logs
              
   - Expected result:
      - Files exist with content
      - Files are non-empty
     
If a run fails, see [TroubleShooting](https://intel-retail.github.io/documentation/use-cases/loss-prevention/getting_started.html#troubleshooting)


__Stop the application__
```sh
make down-lp
```


## Advanced Usage
**Build images locally** (instead of pulling pre-built):
```sh
#Download the models
make download-models REGISTRY=false
#Update github performance-tool submodule
make update-submodules REGISTRY=false
#Download sample videos used by the performance tools
make download-sample-videos REGISTRY=false
#Run the LP application for visual mode
make run-render-mode DISPLAY=:0 REGISTRY=false RENDER_MODE=1
or
#Run the LP application for headless mode
make run REGISTRY=false
```
- Or simply:
- Visual Mode
```sh
make run-lp DISPLAY=:0 REGISTRY=false RENDER_MODE=1
```
- Headless Mode
```sh
make run-lp REGISTRY=false
```

### Stream-density benchmark settings

These settings control which configurations are benchmarked and how the stream-density search measures each density step.

| Setting | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `CAMERA_STREAM` | Camera/workload configuration | `camera_to_workload.json` |
| `WORKLOAD_DIST` | Workload-to-pipeline configuration | `workload_to_pipeline.json` |
| `INIT_DURATION` | Settle time before FPS measurement begins at each density step | `60` seconds |
| `MEASUREMENT_WINDOW_SECONDS` | FPS collection duration per window | `30` seconds |
| `DENSITY_INCREMENT` | Pipelines added during scaling | `1` |
| `TARGET_FPS` | Explicit override for all streams | unset |
| `targetFps` (JSON field) | Per-camera target in `camera_to_workload_*.json` | Per configuration |

### Configuration & user-defined workloads
- Workloads are configured by JSON in `configs/` plus the `CAMERA_STREAM` / `WORKLOAD_DIST` env vars (CPU/GPU/NPU/hetero variants, [availability varies by use case](#per-use-case-walkthroughs)). You can also **define your own**: map cameras to custom pipelines by editing `camera_to_workload_*.json` (which cameras run which workloads) and `workload_to_pipeline_*.json` (each workload’s *pipeline*, a sequence of GStreamer elements + models, e.g. `gvadetect` / `gvaclassify`, on a chosen device). See the [Documentation Guide](https://intel-retail.github.io/documentation/use-cases/loss-prevention/getting_started.html) for pre-configured workloads and [User-Defined Workloads](https://intel-retail.github.io/documentation/use-cases/loss-prevention/advanced.html#user-defined-workloads) for the full definitions.

- Inference interval

   The `INFERENCE_INTERVAL` environment variable controls how often the detector runs        inference (the `gvadetect inference-interval` property). A value of `N` runs inference    on every `N`th frame and relies on the tracker for the frames in between.

    - Default: `3`
    - `1`: run inference on every frame (smoothest, most consistent detections; highest load)
    - `2`, `3`, and up: infer less frequently (better performance, more reliance on the tracker between frames)

```sh
make run-lp CAMERA_STREAM=camera_to_workload_asc_object_detection_classification.json WORKLOAD_DIST=workload_to_pipeline_asc_object_detection_classification_gpu.json RENDER_MODE=1 DISPLAY=:0 INFERENCE_INTERVAL=1
```

## Architecture & services

The system runs as a set of **Docker** containers orchestrated by `docker-compose`. AI inference runs on **OpenVINO™** across Intel® **CPU / iGPU / NPU**; the video-analytics pipeline is built with **GStreamer** (Intel® DLStreamer `gvadetect / gvaclassify` elements) and generated dynamically from the config files; and video is fed in over **RTSP**. The sections below cover that streaming source, the container services, and the repository layout.

### RTSP streaming architecture
An integrated **MediaMTX** RTSP server (`rtsp-streamer` container) streams the sample video files for testing and development.

#### How it works

1. **RTSP server container** (`rtsp-streamer`): auto-starts MediaMTX on port **8554**; streams every `.mp4` in `performance-tools/sample-media/;` each video becomes an RTSP stream at `rtsp://rtsp-streamer:8554/<video-name>.`

2. **Pipeline consumption**: GStreamer pipelines connect via the rtspsrc element, with TCP transport, configurable latency, and automatic retry/timeout handling.

3. Stream naming convention: e.g. video `items-in-basket-32658421-1080-15-bench.mp4` → stream `rtsp://rtsp-streamer:8554/items-in-basket-32658421-1080-15-bench.`

#### RTSP server features

- **Loop playback**: videos restart automatically when finished
- **TCP transport**: reliable streaming over corporate networks
- **Low latency**: 200 ms default for real-time processing
- **Multiple streams**: supports concurrent camera streams
- **Proxy support**: works through corporate HTTP/HTTPS proxies

### Docker Services

| Service | Purpose | Port | Notes |
|---------|---------|------|-------|
| `rtsp-streamer` | RTSP video streaming server | 8554 | Streams videos from sample-media |
| `rabbitmq` | Message broker for VLM workload | 5672, 15672 | Requires credentials |
| `minio-service` | Object storage for frames | 4000, 4001 | S3-compatible storage |
| `model-downloader` | Downloads AI models | - | Runs once at startup |
| `lp-vlm-workload-handler` | VLM inference processor | - | GPU/CPU inference |
| `vlm-pipeline-runner` | VLM pipeline orchestrator | - | Requires DISPLAY variable |
| `lp-pipeline-runner` | Main inference pipeline | - | Supports CPU/GPU/NPU |

All services run on `my_network` bridge network for DNS resolution;use `rtsp-streamer`, `rabbitmq`, `minio-service` as hostnames for inter-service communication
